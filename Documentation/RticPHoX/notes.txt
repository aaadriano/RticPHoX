Started the TeX documentation project of RticPHoX.
The goal is to have the system documented with theory of operation not
available in Oxygen-based documentation.

sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base

% DON"T BOTHER WITH THE FOLLOWING IF/SINCE NOT USING TIKZ.
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra  # for tikz      << TODO
sudo apt-get install texlive-math-extra   # for stmaryrd

Try "latexml" from the Repository. Example,
%>
latexml --dest=RticPHoX.xml RticPHoX.tex
latexmlpost --dest=RticPHoX.xhtml RticPHoX


We do the following for pdf instead of pdflatex (two step) because it can't handle .EPS
%>
latex RticPHoX.tex
dvipdf RticPHoX.dvi

TODO: get ANT running for building the docs.
